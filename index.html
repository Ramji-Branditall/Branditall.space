                        Kushal Indoor Garden is one of the largest suppliers of artificial plants, flowers, vertical green walls, turf, and planters. When they came to us, they had a logo — but nothing else was cohesive.

                    <p>
                        We took their existing logo, vectorized and refined it for flawless use at any scale, then built out their entire brand presence from scratch: letterhead, thank-you cards, price cards, flex banners, vinyl office branding, ID cards with lanyards, brochures, a product catalog, staff T-shirts, social media posts, and ongoing festival wishes for their customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, every piece of their brand — from the walls of their office to the phones of their customers — speaks the same visual language.
